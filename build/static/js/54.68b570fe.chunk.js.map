Non-Life-Threatening\r\n                    Medical Assistance requires notification within 7 days of\r\n                    the first symptom.

Travel Assist is the\r\n                    guaranteed cashless claims process. This means that if a\r\n                    member uses Hop! assistance services, they don't have to\r\n                    worry about paying out of pocket for medical expenses.\r\n                    Instead, Hop! takes care of everything for them, making it\r\n                    incredibly easy and stress-free to use the program.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    When a member needs medical assistance while traveling, they\r\n                    can simply call Hop! Travel Assist to start the process.\r\n                    Hop! will then make all the necessary appointments for the\r\n                    member, including appointments with doctors, hospitals, and\r\n                    other healthcare providers. This eliminates the hassle and\r\n                    stress of trying to find medical care in an unfamiliar\r\n                    location.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Once the member receives the necessary medical care, Hop!\r\n                    will take care of the payment process for them. They will\r\n                    work directly with the healthcare provider to ensure that\r\n                    the member doesn't have to pay anything out of pocket. This\r\n                    means that the member can focus on their recovery without\r\n                    having to worry about the financial aspect of their medical\r\n                    care.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    Hop! also offers assistance for prescription drugs, dental\r\n                    emergencies, medical evacuation, and repatriation of\r\n                    remains.

If a traveler is required to\r\n                    quarantine due to COVID-19, Hop! will cover hotel expenses\r\n                    during that time.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    For travelers who need to be evacuated, Hop! offers air\r\n                    ambulance services as an optional add-on.

If flights are delayed or cancelled, Hop!\r\n                    provides for the cost of rebooking.
